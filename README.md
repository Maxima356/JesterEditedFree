When he begins to turn the crank, the sound *Hava Nagila Original* is triggered.<br>

*Two random sounds* are available, the randomness is generated when your game is launched, i.e. if *Audio_01* is loaded then it will remain so until lethal compagny is restarted.

The 2 random ones are: [Red_sun_in_the_sky](https://youtu.be/_TiSUBMCJ90) and [Ching_chang_hon_chi](https://youtu.be/VN-DG5MgDy0?si=fGLylF8kT_Mx01Wg).
